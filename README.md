# Ashteroide's DIY Arduboy!

<i>Instead of sleeping I decided to make a whole repository for my future project `:P`</i>

<strong><i>This is nowhere near complete, this repository is so that anyone has the option to continue the project if they want</i></strong>

<h2>The Plan</h2>
<li>The idea behind this is to create an open source version of the popular Arduboy for other people to make at home</li>
<li>I want to finish this project entirely before June 2022</li>
<li>Make it easily accessible, buildable, and interchangeable for small or large modifications</li>
<li>Provide support for people interested or experiencing troubles with the design or files (Do note my electronics skills are limited and I do not have a degree of any sort)</li>

*More Components will be added eventually*|

*I've tried to keep the shipping costs either free or low, and shipping times to be less than 3 months*

<h2>The PCB</h2>

The PCB is intended to be:
* Credit card sized (Commonly 60x90mm)
* Sturdy and built well
* Components can be easily replaced
* Include a comfortable case with nice buttons

(Details and images will be released eventually)
